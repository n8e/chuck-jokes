# chuck-jokes

GraphQL, Apollo, React app wrapping the Chuck Norris API (https://api.chucknorris.io/) ðŸš€
See [server codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/chuck-jokes-server-ot647) and [client sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/chuck-jokes-client-u6w9f). Note that the server needs to run first before the client

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `server`: Containing graphQL setup, schema, resolvers and datasources
- `client`: React-made side of the application


## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd client && npm i && npm start
```
